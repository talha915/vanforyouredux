        title: 'About Van For You',
        description: 'Van For You has been trading in London for over fifteen years and is now London’s #1 man and van, removals and storage business. Since our inception, we’ve grown rapidly by following a simple principle – great service to our customers, all of the time. This keeps our phones ringing and our trucks and men busy seven days a week – yes, that means we’re open on Sundays. The original business opened in 2001, offering a man and van delivery service, with just one man and one van. We brought great quality, innovation and reliability to an otherwise lacklustre UK industry and our value for money was second to none, as it remains. Demand grew quickly, in no small part due to our “Can Do” attitude – no job too big or too small, and every customer request met with a cheery and forthright “Can Do” response.',
